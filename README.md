# Space Invaders

Space Invaders game is a classic arcade style 2D shooting game wherein the player spaceship shoots the enemies while avoiding their attacks. In fact, this is the end product of my team's project for _CS350-Introduction to Software Engineering_ from KAIST.

It is freely available to play on
[GX.games](https://gx.games/) via this [link](https://gx.games/games/lvide4/kaist-space-invaders/) or by searching â€˜KAIST Space Invadersâ€™ on the platform. Even though it can be played directly within the Chrome browser, it doesn't support direct execution within other browsers. In such a case, one will need to install Opera GX as they mention to run the game. Alternatively, one can download this source code, and run it on the [Game Maker
Studio](https://gamemaker.io/en) installed on the machine.

## Enemies and Bosses

Each phase introduces a new type of enemy. Their characteristics are as follows.

- Type 1: static and donâ€™t shoot
- Type 2: static and shoot
- Type 3: dynamic and donâ€™t shoot
- Type 4: dynamic and shoot

Starting from Phase 2, each phase culminates in a boss. Their characteristics are as follows.

![Bosses](readme_media/bosses.jpg)

- Boss 1: It has many turrets that shoot cannons and lasers in all directions.
- Boss 2: It deflects attacks on most of its surface, and has a small vulnerable area. It means that if the playerâ€™s laser hits the areas other than the vulnerable area of the boss, its HP wonâ€™t decrease. It can shoot homing missiles along with other various attacks.
- Boss 3: To kill the boss, one must attack specific vulnerable points in a specified order. Otherwise, attacks are ignored. The vulnerable points blink. The final boss has a special attack,
  pulling asteroids from behind the player to attack. If the player evades, the boss may be hit. It can also shoot homing missiles

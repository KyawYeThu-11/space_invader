5. Dogi (28th May)
Changes!
changes obj_Room_Setup -> it is divided in 3 to make the sequential transition effect work
needs to recheck the position of the player_ship and enemy spawning
some bckg sprite name and assignment change
some sprite animatings 

Additions
- Sequences -> phase_transitions -> initial and ending player ship sequences AND phrase sequence
- Objects for those sequences (for sequences and for transitions)

Notice
- Needs to manually set up player_ship position for sequence after fixing the position

4. Ye Thu (27th May)
Additions 
- spawning enemies and switching rooms when all of them die work now!

Changes
- Obj_spawner_enemies file is changed

Notice
- The enemies are chosen at random, but the distibution is not even.

3. Ahmed (May 24th)
Additions
-Added sprites to the objects
-Added the 4th object

Changes
- phase 1 is kind of completed with the layout and stuff

2. Dogi (May 23rd)

Additions
- backgrounds that constantly move for each phases

Changes
- now the enemy sprites are 64pixels x 64pixels (i can do other sizes too, if needed)

Notice
- Pls do not change the order of bckg in phase 1 - it does the job only that way
- Pls tell me whatever that needs to be done for you by the 'room person' -half is me
	I will try to do it as quick as possible but you need to tell me first cuz I am not very knowledgable in
	how the things are depending on each other
	

1. Ye Thu (22th May)

Additions
- Main menu
- Pause menu
- Transitions between each phase room

Changes
- Change the name of the layer, "Instance_1" into "Instances" in rm_Main
(to be consistent with the default "Instances" layer when a new room is created)
- Comment out camera_set_view_size() code in the Create event of obj_Camera
(otherwise it isn't compatiable with the size of the pause menu and main menu animations)


Notice for others
- Since the enemies are moving in each phase
- In each phase room
	- There must be obj_game_manager object in Instances layer for the pause menu to work
	- There must be Bullets layer
- The main code for transition between rooms can be found in obj_Enemy object.
- rm_Init: You won't see this room because it contains obj_init object, which set things up
	and then move to rm_main_menu room
- The order of rooms is important because I've linked according to the order
